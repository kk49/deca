# ((DE)C)onstructor for (A)pps (DECA)

["Everything should be built top-down, except the first time." - Alan Perlis](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/perlis-alan/quotes.html)

**Code contributions are more than welcome!!!**

A hacked up tool for exploring/extracting/modding files from Avalanche Studios APEX engine files, 
mainly Generation Zero.

Written in Python, tested only on Linux, code is a mess, because this is an experiment...

## (Pre-)Releases for Windows
https://github.com/kk49/deca/releases

*Development Releases are on the Discord*

## Discord
For **deca** specific and general GenZero, theHunter:COTW, and other APEX engine games modding.
Also has a channel for development releases of **deca**

https://discord.gg/x5AuPj7

## Key Features
* Export (modelc, meshc, hrmeshc) to GLTF 2.0 (material models not complete/missing, no bones)
* Export ADF encoded spreadsheets
* Export textures to PNG
* Parsing most ADF files (Gen Zero)
* GUI to explore archive files
* Basic rebuilding of archive files to update textures, Characters/Machines work. Set pieces do not.

## "Supported" Games
Support varies among the games, people are activily using **deca** for GenZero and theHunter:COTW

|GAME|
|---|
|Avalanche Studios' Generation Zero®|
|Avalanche Studios' theHunter™: Call of the Wild|
|Avalanche Studios' Just Cause 3|
|Avalanche Studios' Just Cause 4|
|Avalanche Studios' RAGE 2|

## Quick Start
No installer, just unzip the [release file](https://github.com/kk49/deca/releases) in some directory and start deca_gui.exe. (not signed so windows will complain)
Go to the menu and under File select New Project ..., find theHunter EXE, and wait 40 minutes the first time.
It does a bunch of work to figure out possible file names, and python multiprocessing on Windows is a pain.

It will uncompress all the compressed sections of the archives and place them into "__ CACHE __" in the project 
directory.

It currently creates a work/hp directory one directory above where deca_gui.exe is. So you can used File/Open Project 
and find the project.json file to open it again. Ignore the log tab on the left and take a look at the DIR tab, which 
shows the entry VFS layout. Double click on nodes and the contents (if **deca** can parse them) appears in the tables on 
the right.

Individual files can be extracted with the EXTRACT button after they are selected with one click. They are placed in 
the project directory under "extracted". Folders can be extracted recursively so be careful unless you want to expand 
gigabytes of data.

Modding is a work in progress, files are extracted with the PREP MOD button and placed in the "mod" sub-directory.
BUILD MOD will then package up all the files in the mod directory (which you can/must edit by hand right now) and 
places the results into the "build" sub-directory. The build directory contents can then be copied to the normal 
"dropzone" folder like in JC3 (I have not tested it with theHunter, only GZB, and even then all I know is that the 
game does not crash before it gets to BETA over screen)
